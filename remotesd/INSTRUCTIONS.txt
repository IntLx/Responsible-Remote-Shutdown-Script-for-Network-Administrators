In this example, the shutdown_remote_computer function takes the hostname or IP address of the remote computer as an argument and sends the shutdown command using the os.system function with the appropriate parameters for a Windows system.

Please note that remote shutdown functionality may require specific configurations, such as enabling remote management and administrative access, depending on your network setup and security settings. Make sure you have the necessary privileges and permissions before attempting to remotely shut down a computer.

Additionally, be cautious when using remote shutdown capabilities and ensure that you have proper authorization and consent to perform such actions.
